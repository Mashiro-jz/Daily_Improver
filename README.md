## daily_helper - description

Daily_helper is a simple application that contains 3 zones: habit_tracker, to-do list and replay zone.

# Habit tracker - zone 1

A simple habit tracker that allows the user to define activities once and mark them as done or not each day.
It also includes statistics that show the percentage of completed activities over a selected period of time.

# To-do list - zone 2

A to-do list that allows the user to easily write down tasks that need to be done during the day.
The user can also schedule tasks for future dates, such as weeks or months ahead, using a built-in calendar.

# Replay zone - zone 3

This zone allows the user to write short notes about what they have learned during any activity such as reading, programming, etc.
After defining categories for repeated activities, the user can add short reflections or insights related to those activities.

Short notes contain the name of the activity (for example, the title of a book for the reading category),
the date the note was created (auto-assigned), and a description.
